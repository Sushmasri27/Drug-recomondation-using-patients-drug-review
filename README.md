# Drug Recommendation Using Patients Drug Review

This is a web-based drug recommendation system developed using Python and Flask. It allows users to enter a medical condition and receive drug suggestions based on real patient reviews. The system filters and displays relevant reviews, generates word clouds from feedback, and presents data insights like rating distributions and top-reviewed conditions.

The project demonstrates concepts like data filtering with Pandas, visualizations using Matplotlib, and basic NLP for word cloud generation. It is beginner-friendly, fully functional on the backend, and built without any machine learning â€” making it a great starting point for healthcare-focused data projects.
